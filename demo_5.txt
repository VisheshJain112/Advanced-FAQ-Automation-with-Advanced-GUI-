Paid Classes Sales Pitch


Hi (Parent's Name), My name is (Tele-caller) calling from Cuemath - The pioneer in re defining Math learning for kids across globe.


Your demo class is successfully completed and we are glad to increase mathematical thinking of your child even further. 


I intend to let you know how (kid name) has performed.


(kid name) was found really bright and Teacher scored 5 out of 5 stars for his/her performance. 


Only 14.5% of the kids Manage to accomplish those...so congratulations! Your kid is actually very bright.




I also wanted to get some real-time feedback from you on the:-


● Engagement Level of <Kid Name> - was in engrossed solving problems along with teacher?


● How did you find (Teacher’s) ability to explain and relate with (kid)


● Any other feedback you had on the platform? Was it easy to navigate and understand?




ABOUT US


We’re the first structured Math curriculum ever created in the world for kids.


As you know, the urgency for kids to learn maths is higher than ever and schools have


Struggled to create relevant courses because of the shortage of teachers.


● World economic forum says – All jobs will go away if AI is not learnt in early stages of life Math is the base and key to learn Artificial Intelligence
● Math is the Language of Thinking and we teach this Language in a way to increase logical ability through one on one live session, so that Kid’s Logical reasoning doubles – Speed of solving math problems go up
●   Our Objective is to get everybody math at intuition 


Case study examples – 


Sometime a go with did survey with some school students and asked them which number is greater – 0.19 or 0.2? most of them had 0.19 as there answer as it had Number 19 in it. However, in Cuemath students learn Decimal in a different way through Visual Modelling of blocks and hence it becomes much easier for them to identify right answer though visuals and remember it for a longer duration. 


I have sent you two links on your registered phone number and sincerely request you to go through them to understand how our teachers teach with ease.

CURRICULUM DETAILS


Our program has Two Major value Propositions


Proposition 1 (Math) : There are 2 classes conducted per week. Each class is of 55/40 minutes (55 mins if the grade of the regular classes as well. Homework will be regularly uploaded on the portal for (Kid) to complete. The teachers who took the demo today will be the same teacher allocated to your Kid within 7 days and the tutor will be able to evaluate and provide the feedback on the same.

Apart from the homework, We have three additional deliverable which Kid will be getting:

Math gym App : This is an application which you can download on any smart phone and Kid can practice on it for 10 mins on a daily basis. It has been seen that the children practicing math on the daily basis on this app for 6 months are 3 times faster than their peers
Aptitude E books : These books help the children to prepare for competitions like IMO and state level achievement tests.
Puzzle cards: At the end of every class, the teacher assigns a puzzle card to your childs which will help develop his logical reasoning skills.

Curriculum : We follow the standard USCC/Canadian (depends on the country) being followed in your child’s School. So the curriculum will be in direct alignment with the school curriculum.
Also, you will have a luxury of customising the curriculum as per your child’s requirement.


Proposition 2 (Coding): Here, your kid will learn design thinking. He'll learn to code front-end with


UI(User Interface) and UX(User Experience) design. With this, the single biggest difference


that you'll see with that is that your kid will become a creator for life. There'll be a


fundamental psychological shift that occurs in him wherein he will start thinking that


everything in the world is an object created by someone and he can be a creator too.* The


earlier the shift happens in a kid, the earlier they’ll make a massive impact in the world.


● Elon Musk, best known for founding Tesla, Space X, and PayPal now, programmed his


first video game Blastar in 1984, when he was just 12 years old!




You can imagine if your kid could create an app at age 7, he will be very young entrepreneur in


just a couple of years. Like Ritesh Agarwal, who founded Oyo Rooms at age 21, and is the


youngest billionaire in India, who started coding at Age 9. 


Your Kid will learn Free - standing syntax through Java/Python and 


 will combine both back-end and front-end concepts in syntax.


●   All programming problems are math problems not coding problems / Have you compressed a file on laptop or desktop?  Or have you filed  any online form on any website?– All of it is Math backed up and then converted in AI or ML




With AI taking 80 Million jobs in 2020, the urgency to be a creator is now stronger than


ever. According to Mckinsey, in just 7 years, only 5% of people will be creating and giving


orders to the machine, 95% will be taking orders from the machine. Your kid should be a


creator in this new world.






Sub- Pitch for Girl Child


(Girl Child) Women and Men are represented 50%-50% in all higher education spheres. But in


coding, we have 87% of men and 13% of women and as a result, entrepreneurship has 93%


men and 7% women. Our systems send the wrong signals to women that they can’t do


Analytical thinking or code. That’s why your girl should take the course now.

URGENCY PITCH


One other thing I wanted to share is that since we're a mission driven platform rather than a


money driven platform, we don't want parents to ever have a dissonance that their trial


teacher was different from the paid teacher. Hence we only map your trial class teacher to


be your final teacher.. 


We’d love (Kid) to join us as <he/she> is a 5 star kid. We love having 5 star kids on the


platform since they become great ambassadors of the program.




<IF PARENT SAY CALL ME TOMORROW>  - Sure! But try your best to let me know by midnight


today. I can see in my system that (Teacher) still has 4 trials today and since most


customers are signing up for a full course, she’ll likely reach her 10 students soon. And as I


said, we’re a mission driven rather than a money driven platform. We only want the trial


teacher to be the paid teacher.






REFUND POLICY


You should also know we have a:


NO-QUESTIONS ASKED, SEVEN DAY, 100% REFUND POLICY. As you can see on our website,


We’ve taken an indemnity to refund on the Seventh day. 


If you’re not happy with the course at any point, we’ll refund the remaining classes back.




So, if you’re not happy after the 1st class, we’ll refund the remaining all classes back. 


I must tell you though this has never happened to us as our renewal rate is 99.3%.


So less than 0.7% of students have asked for a refund, the lowest in the education Industry. 










FOLLOW-UP URGENC


FEE STRUCTURE DETAILS:-


We have 3 subscriptions to choose from:-


● 3 Months Basic- (2 classes per week, 8 classes per month)
 $330 for 24 classes which is at $13.75 / class




● 10 Months Expert- (2 classes per week, 8 classes per month)
$1000 for 24 classes which is at $41.60 / class






● 6 Months Intermediate- (2 classes per week, 8 classes per month)
$600 for 24 classes which is at $25 / class




We recommend taking either the 6 Months Intermediate package or 10 Months Expert package


Because:


1. We align (Teacher's name) for all of (Student's name) for all classes. Kids form a very


Strong emotional bond with the teacher so we’d love to have them continue with the same


Teacher for the entire classes. What happens in the Basic Package, once the


Classes are completed, you’ll be in the same pool as the rest of the kids and since we’re


always running over-booked, their teacher won’t be available. We try our best from the


back-end to assign the same teacher but are usually unable to do so since our teachers are


always running fully booked. And we know, the kids will always want to continue since we


have a 99.3% renewal rate.




2. You get a 20% discount immediately.




3. Finally as I said, we have a NO-QUESTIONS ASKED, SAME-DAY 100% REFUND POLICY. 
We’ve taken a legal indemnity to refund on the same day. 




Finally, you should know about our free scheduling policy.


You decide the date and time of the class. Between Mon - Fri 4 to 9 pm and Saturday -


Sunday 9 am to 9 pm, you need to select any 2 classes of your choice. (We block an hour,


However, the class is typically of 40 mins) Again, after scheduling, in case you need to


Reschedule, just inform us 24 hours in advance and we'll happily reschedule.


We will dedicate Relationship manager for your assistance and for all possible types of Assistance and requests pertaining to journey – will be the first Point of contact.




FAQs:-


1) I need to discuss it with my Husband.


Ans - Yes, Please do that, however, our teachers wish for all their slots to be booked for


which they do demo classes. So in case you're not going ahead, request you to kindly let us


know in (2-4 hours from the time of the demo class) as we need to align her for additional


demo classes.


So I'll call you by ... mention a time, make an entry in your sales log and set a calendar


reminder. Reminder with Call Kid's Mother/Father (Class - 1st Feb).




2) I will do it in the holidays.


Ans - The platform has been created to compliment academics. Kids on the platform has


shown a massive rise in concentration levels, logical reasoning, and improved academic


scores. Infact one of our kids became #1 in the International Mathematics Olympiad. If you


wait until holidays, you will lose out on the teacher.




3) Involved in too many activities.


Ans - I understand and really appreciate that he's utilizing his time so well. We really suggest


that (student's name) makes time for coding through our flexible scheduling policy.






4) Math is being taught in the school.


Ans - Our platform is 1:6  Live class, where focused attention will be given to your child,


creating an open space for him and to not shy away from asking doubts and clarifications.


This is why our Live Classes are being loved far and wide and also the reason why the


Investors have heavily invested in us as well. A teacher in a school, can't address


the doubts of 30+ kids and maintain a speed that is favourable to all kids.




5) Where are your teachers from?


Top colleges of India who have a passion for teaching Math backed with an MS, MCA,


etc




8) How can I know that this is not a fraud company?


State your Name and they could check it on LinkedIn and social accounts. More importantly,


you should look my CEO & COO up - Mr. Manan  & Mr. Govind Rajan. 
You could also visit our office... Also, we have Top investors on board, and have heavily invested in us thereby ensuring our team is robust and ready to scale.


Most importantly we have our legacy foundation course supporting Multiple Tier I and II cities of India with more than 6000 teachers on board visiting students at their door step and we have presence in various cities in India. Please feel free to visit nearest office once Lock down is over.
