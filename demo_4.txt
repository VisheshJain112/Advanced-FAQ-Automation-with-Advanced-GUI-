FINAL SALES PITCH




SUMMARY 


1. PROBLEM SOLVING = DECISION MAKER (5%)
In the coming AI world Problem solving is the skill set to build. If you are good at problem solving you will be a decision maker (5%), else a follower (95%)


2. PROBLEM SOLVING = MATH + CODING 
All things we think are computing is actually math. 
Math is the actual language of problem solving. 
Coding is the language of telling machines how to go about solving the problem repeatedly thru instructions 
   
3. LEARN MATH LIKE YOU LEARN A LANGUAGE 
Do you learn english only at school? If your kid learnt english and spoke english only for 2 hours a day, using only school textbooks would that be good enough? Will you be happy if your kid starts learning English at Grade 10


4. MATH HAS NEVER BEEN MORE IMPORTANT
SCHOOL METHODS HAVE NEVER BEEN MORE OUTDATED (THEREFORE RISK?)
Even school textbooks may not have changed! And yet the world is rapidly changing
If you think of the way school textbooks teach math, it is almost like if english textbooks only taught vocabulary. You will have a big vocabulary, but not much use, as there is not intuitive practice.  


5. MATH AS A LANGUAGE = NATURAL PROBLEM SOLVER 
Do you think about grammar when you speak or does it come naturally? Similarly when you problem solve, can you solve problems which are not there in the textbooks? How to make your kid see the answer immediately rather than take time to arrive at it. Make your kid as NATURAL at problem solving as he/she is in english. 




6. LEARN MATH EARLY = NATURAL PROBLEM SOLVER =  BUILD A LIFE-LONG ADVANTAGE 
Learning Math like a language is building an unbeatable LIFE-LONG advantage in the coming AI world, Like learning english early has been an advantage in today’s world.  


7. PROBLEM SOLVING IN DAILY LIFE - WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?


Your kid will start asking 
* WHY > WHAT : Ask why not just follow instructions from someone else on what to do 
* CREATE > USE : Will want to create on their own not just use what someone else has built 
* DATA > OPINION : Investigate data on their own  not just follow someone else’s opinion 
* OPTIMAL > PERFECT DECISION : Make different decisions depending on the circumstances, not just follow someone else’s decision again and again

HI HELLO : HERE IS FEEDBACK ON YOUR KID 
Hi (Parent's Name), My name is (Tele-caller) calling from Cuemath. Wanted to give you Feedback from the teacher on the kids performance. We will also send a detailed report. Can you confirm the email ID. 


TEACHER LOVED YOUR INTERACTING WITH YOUR KID 
I want to tell you how (kid name) has performed.


The (Teacher name) really liked interacting with (Kid Name). Her comments were that the (Kid Name) is Bright / Hardworking / Interested. She awarded him 5/5 stars for his effort in the demo2.  Ou data shows Only 14.5% of the kids Manage to accomplish that...so congratulations! Your kid is actually very bright.


I also wanted to get some feedback from you on the:-


● Engagement Level of <Kid Name> - Was he/she engrossed in problem solving along with the teacher?


● How did you find (Teacher’s) ability to explain and relate with (kid)


● Any other feedback you had on the platform? Was it easy to navigate and understand?


WHAT WAS YOUR GOAL FOR THE DEMO?
Before we go forward Can I ask, what is it that PROMPTED you to ask for a demo  
1. Specific Subject Help - in a subject, Is good get much better
2. Get Ahead by building better life skills (in problem solving) 


I AM NOT SELLING : WANT TO MAKE SURE WE ARE THE RIGHT FIT 
Before I go on to the next steps about the course etc I would like to explain a bit about - SLOW CLEAR EMPHATIC VOICE - WHAT WE DO AND HOW WE DO IT. (Say it twice). What we do and Why we do it. And for you to assess if we are a good fit. 
Ma’am / Sir Can I take a minute or two to explain it?  


BEING A “NATURAL” PROBLEM SOLVER IS THE MOST IMPORTANT ABILITY YOUR CHILD CAN BUILD 
At Cuemath our goal is to help kids become NATURAL problem solvers. Why ? 
In this age of data and AI, your child will end up either as a decision-maker1, or as a follower. The difference? NATURAL2 Problem-solving ability! 


PROBLEM SOLVING MINDSET = DECISION MAKER 
As even highly specialised jobs get automated, the future will be ruled by problem-solvers.That's the most important ability your child could build today! 


Problem solvers like Bill Gates who is taking his problem solving mindset to other problems like heath - Coronavirus3 not just computing, Elon Musk4 who is more than a coder, he is math Whiz and solves problems in space exploration. Nandan Nilekani - Not just Infosys5 he built the Pioneering Aadhaar system in India.  


BECOME AS “NATURAL” PROBLEM SOLVER AS YOUR KID IS A “NATURAL” IN ENGLISH 
Cuemath is different 6 and delivers results BECAUSE we teach Math / Coding - like kids learn a language, example english, is best learnt by doing,  that is speaking english. >70% of our curriculum questions are VISUAL, not text book type. 100% is learning by DOING. and when you learn as a language you build ability, not just knowledge.


For example : Grammar you know what is right and wrong without knowing the rule, and our goal is to build similar confidence with Problem solving. Being a NATURAL is when you have the Confidence do something without thinking, it comes automatically. 


MATH and CODING ARE THE BEST WAY OF BEING NATURAL PROBLEM SOLVERS
Math is the language of thinking of problem solving. 
Coding is the language of instructing machines telling machines how to solve the problem 
When you learn Math and Coding just the way you learn a language you learn not just the words, but also become fluent in the Grammar of Math and Coding which makes your kid a natural problem solver. 


WE ARE GLOBAL : PRESENT IN THE MOST CUTTING EDGE MARKETS 
We are a global company. Present in 17 countries across America Like USA, Europe like UK and France and Asia Like Singapore and Australia. Our goal with math/coding is ambitious. It is to build a generation of problem solvers and decision makers. We are backed by Google and Sequoia the No.1 Tech company and No 1 Tech Investor globally. 


WHY START EARLY : A LANGUAGE GIVES A LIFE LONG ADVANTAGE 
JUST Like it is important to learn a language early, kids who learn a language like english early have an advantage that is life long! Problem solving and not english is the gateway to success in the world.  
WHAT RESULTS CAN I EXPECT ? 
1. BECOME A LIFE LONG DECISION MAKER NOT A FOLLOWER   
In 12 months Both speed and Logical thinking ability doubles. Doubles! And this shows up in Mark's as well. 
But better marks in Math is just the beginning of a LIFE LONG LIFE LONG change.  Most importantly you will see a BIG change in MINDSET. And the way they approach problems. 
Instead of just being satisfied with an answer they will 
1. WHY > WHAT : Ask why not just follow instructions from someone else on what to do 
2. BECOME CREATORS : They will want to create on their own not just use what someone else has built 
3. DATA > OPINION : Investigate data on their own  not just follow someone else’s opinion 
4. OPTIMAL > PERFECT DECISION : Make different decisions depending on the circumstances, not just follow someone else’s decision again and again 
There'll be a fundamental psychological shift, as she/he will start thinking that he or she can solve problems and more importantly WANT TO SOLVE THEM.  This is more important than marks.  


The earlier the shift happens in a kid, the earlier they will make a massive impact in the world.


2. RESULTS : LOVE MATH IN 3-6 MONTHS
With this, the single biggest difference that you'll see within 6 months is that your kid will Love Math and will love coming to Math class. And we know Nothing boosts the confidence of a school kid like proficiency in math or a sport. But it will take 3- 6 months, PLEASE BE PATIENT. AND HELP THE TEACHER HELP THE CHILD. 


3. RESULTS : IT WILL TAKE 6-12 MONTHS FOR THESE RESULTS TO START SHOWING 


WHAT ARE THE COURSE OPTIONS?


We offer 2 Major value propositions/ courses 




Option 1 (Math) : 


Frequency : There are 2 classes conducted per week. 
Duration : Each class is of 45 minutes 
Each class with a teacher 


Curriculum : We follow the standard (depends on the country) being followed in your child’s School. So the curriculum will be in direct alignment with the state/national/common code curriculum.


Limitless Practice : Homework will be regularly uploaded on the portal for (Kid) to complete. On top of that the child can practice as much as they want. Whenever they want. At their own pace.  


Problem solving practice in every class : At the end of every class, the teacher assigns a problem solving card to your childs which will help develop problem solving skills . Children love these cards and even sometimes solve stuff their parents cannot. These are problems that schools do not cover. And many times there are MULTIPLE correct answers, just like in real life.  


Same teacher : The teachers who took the demo today will be the “same” teacher for you
Feedback: In 14 days (4 sessions) and the tutor will be able to start providing Feedback

Teacher will schedule a PTM every month in one of the classes for 20 min: Your teacher may seek your help, give feedback and ask for feedback every month. The teacher will schedule a Monthly debrief with you during one of the classes. In addition you will get regular updates on everyday activity on the platform. 


Our teachers are well qualified: Our teachers are tested and certified on many parameters. Apart from Math they are tested on their ability to get the best out of every child and make the class engaging for the child.  


Free Math gym App : This is an application which you can download on any smartphone and Kid can practice on it. We recommend a minimum of 10 mins daily. Think of it as a quick Math workout for the brain.  Children practicing math on the daily basis on this app for 6 months are upto 2 times faster than their peers. Just like a GYM daily practice for the mind too. 

Aptitude E books : These books help the children to prepare for competitions like IMO and state level achievement tests.



RESULTS STEP 1 : LOVE MATH IN 3-6 MONTHS
With this, the single biggest difference that you'll see within 6 months is that your kid will Love Math and will love coming to Math class. And we know Nothing boosts the confidence of a school kid like proficiency in math or a sport. But it will take 3- 6 months, PLEASE BE PATIENT. AND HELP THE TEACHER HELP THE CHILD.  


STEP 2 : PROBLEM SOLVING MINDSET IN 6-12 MONTHS - FUNDAMENTAL SHIFT - AND A LIFE LONG ADVANTAGE 
When they get better at MATH they will develop the PROBLEM SOLVING MINDSET QUICKLY. How can you see this every day  


WHY > WHAT : They will begin to start asking WHY? Not just FOLLOW instructions 
CREATORS : They will want to experiment and create 
DATA > OPINION : Start asking for Data and Evidence, not just follow someone else’s opinion 
OPTIMAL > PERFECT : You child will be able to make different decisions depending on the circumstances, not just follow the same pattern again and again 
There'll be a fundamental psychological shift, as she/he will start thinking that he or she can solve problems and more importantly WANT TO SOLVE THEM.  This is more important than marks.  


The earlier the shift happens in a kid, the earlier they will make a massive impact in the world.






SUB PITCH FOR GIRL CHILD 


(Girl Child) Women and Men are represented 50%-50% in all higher education spheres. But in


Math and computing sciences, we have 80% of men and 20% of women and as a result, amongst decision makers it is even more skewed. 90% Men. less than 10% women. 


Our society images send the wrong signals to girls that they can’t do Analytical thinking, Managing money, Generally at Math or coding skills. Especially if the mother thinks she is not good at Math, research shows that there is more than a 50% chance that the girl child thinks she cannot do math also, which is wrong. That’s why your girl should take the course now.


SUB PITCH FOR HIGH WAGE ECONOMIES : UBER ENGINEER OR UBER DRIVER 
Over the years we have seen that basic engineering and coding jobs are moving to lower cost but well educated destinations like India. iNFOSYS which  India is the data analysis and back office of the world. China started as the factory of the world and is now getting into high tech.


You need to be good at math and other problem solving skills to have a high earning job in America. High paying jobs or very low paying jobs nothing in the middle is the future in a tech driven society for an economy like America.


________________


Proposition 2 (Coding): Here, your kid will learn design thinking. How to make machines do things. He'll learn first to code front-end with UI(User Interface) and UX(User Experience) design. 








●   All programming problems are math problems not coding problems / Have you compressed a file on laptop or desktop?  Or have you filed  any online form on any website?– All of it is Math backed up and then converted in AI or ML


With AI taking 80 Million jobs in 2020, the need to build problem solving skills is now stronger than ever in the coming generation. According to Mckinsey, in just 5-10 years, just as your kid is in college/leaving school 
only 5% of people will be creating AI based models and giving orders to the machine, 
95% will be taking orders from the machine.
MATH + CODING and ONLY MATH can enable your kid to be a creator in this new world.

URGENCY PITCH : BOOK NOW  !
One other thing I wanted to share is that since we're a mission driven platform rather than a money driven platform, we don't want parents to ever have a dissonance that their trial teacher was different from the paid teacher. Hence we only map your trial class teacher to be your final teacher. 


We’d love (Kid) to join us as <he/she> is a 5 star kid. We love having 5 star kids on the platform since they become great ambassadors of the program.




<IF PARENT SAY CALL ME TOMORROW>  TRIAL TEACHER = CLASS TEACHER 
Sure! But try your best to let me know by midnight today. I can see in my system that (Teacher) still has 4 trials ONGOING and since 85% of the customers are signing up for a full course, she’ll likely reach her 10 students soon. And as I said, we’re a mission driven rather than a money driven platform. We only want the trial teacher to be the CLASS teacher.




REFUND POLICY ! : NO QUESTIONS ASKED 7 DAY REFUND POLICY 
You should also know we have a:
NO-QUESTIONS ASKED, SEVEN DAY, 100% REFUND POLICY. As you can see on our website,


We’ve give you an assurance to refund on the Seventh day. 


If you’re not happy with the course at any point, we’ll refund 50% of the remaining classes back.
So, if you’re not happy after the 1st class, we’ll refund the remaining all classes back. 


I must tell you though this has never happened to us as our renewal rate is 99.3%.


So less than 0.7% of students have asked for a refund, the lowest in the education Industry. 


WHY BOOK LONGER : SAME TEACHER
We align (Teacher's name) for all of (Student's name) for all classes. Kids form a very Strong emotional bond with the teacher so we’d love to have them continue with the same Teacher for the entire duration. What happens in the Basic Package, once the Classes are completed, you’ll be in the same pool as the rest of the kids and since we’re mostly running over-booked for existing teachers, that specific teacher won’t be available. We try our best from the back-end to assign the same teacher but are not always able to do so. And we know, the kids will always want to continue since we have a 99% renewal rate.


WHY BOOK LONGER : SAME RENEWAL FEE 
For 6 months and 10 months we promise to keep the same fee for the next renewal. Any prices changes will not be applied to you.  






REBUTTALS 


1) I WILL NEED TO DISCUSS IT WITH MY SPOUSE 


Yes, Please do that, however, our teachers wish for all their slots to be booked for which they do demo classes. So in case you're not going ahead, request you to kindly let us know in (2-4 hours from the time of the demo class) as we need to align her for additional demo classes.


So I'll call you by ... mention a time, make an entry in your sales log and set a calendar reminder. Reminder with Call Kid's Mother/Father (Class - 1st Feb).




2) I WILL DO IT LATER / HOLIDAYS  


* If you wait until holidays, you will lose out on the teacher. 
* Also the faster you start, faster your kid will build confidence in Math, and become a champion problem solver. This is an investment for the future not just CURRENT GRADE
* The platform has been created to complement academics. 
* Kids on the platform has shown a massive rise in concentration levels, Doubling of speed which shows confidence and doubling of logical reasoning. Resulting in improved academic scores. 
* Infact one of our kids became #1 in the International Mathematics Olympiad. 
* Studies have shown that CueMath kids perform better than Kids 2 Grades ahead. 




3) I WILL DO IT LATER / ENGAGED IN OTHER ACTIVITIES 


* I understand and really appreciate that he's utilizing his time so well. 
* We really suggest that (student's name) makes time for Math PROFICIENCY. 
* Math we have seen cannot be learnt later. To be good at Grade 10/12, it’s best to be proficient and like math by the time you are age 10/12. 
* With every passing year it gets more difficult. It is like postponing learning english. 




4) MATH IS ALREADY BEEN TAUGHT IN SCHOOL 




* CANNOT AFFORD TO COMPROMISE ON MATH IN TODAY’S WORLD
WORLD HAS CHANGED, THE WAY SCHOOLS TEACH MATH HAS NOT 


The way Schools math is no different from the way you learnt Math. Even textbooks might not be very different! 


And in the intervening 25 years with AI math has become even more important. 
You cannot afford to compromise on Anything but the best in Math in today’s world.  


* START EARLY ON THE JOURNEY OF BECOMING A PROBLEM SOLVER 
Yes math is indeed taught in schools and the same way as it has been for 25 years. The problem is that it does not make kids confident about math. 


The key point is not exposure to math, but an insane amount of confidence on math. That allows a kid to become a genius problem solver and then become a decision maker.  


This is an investment for the future not just CURRENT GRADE


* EARLY YEARS MATTER MORE 
HOW WILL YOUR KIDS ENGLISH BE WHEN YOU START FOCUSING ON GRADE 10 
Early years matter most in math, more than later years. How will english be if you start focusing on it on Grade X?  


It is very difficult to build math skills later. Almost impossible! Our research shows that of students doing well in Grade 12 / Getting into IIT / Doing well in SAT, 9/10 were proficient at Math early in life (by Age 12). Which is why we focus only on Grades KG to X. 


Which is why we focus on KG to 10. How good you are at Grade X/XII depends essentially on how good you are at age 10/12. (If required Manan Story see FAQs)


* HOW WILL YOUR KIDS ENGLISH IF ALL YOUR KID DID WAS SPAK 2 HOURS OF ENGLISH IN ENGLISH CLASS IN SCHOOL  
Need practice to master. And be taught in an expert way. 




* RESULTS IN 6 MONTHS : Double speed vs School 
When children come into Cuemath from “ONLY SCHOOL” : they double their pace in 6-12 months. Even as your kid has been in school for 4 years, in 1 year Cuemath will double the speed of math. This has proven year after year. Cuemath Method compared to older school teaching makes it twice as faster and better.  


* LEARN TO SEE MATH 
Never Forget : Visual and so engages more of the brain 
School methods are old and they treat it like another subject. We teach math Visually, in a way that engages more of the brain. Kids can learn math in a way they never forget. Once they understand math (which is faster when taught visually) they love math. 


Never Forget because the teacher helps the student self arrive
Teacher CUES the student to arrive at the answer. That is why we are called CUEMATH 


* SCHOOL OPTIMISES FOR THE AVERAGE. GET A PERSONALISED COURSE  
   * A teacher in a school manages for the average of the class. At Cuemath our AI based curriculum customized for each kid that allows them to increase speed. 
   * 1: Few : Also in our class the student size 1:1 / 1:3/1:6. Compared to school you get 10 times the attention creating an open space for him and to not shy away from asking doubts and clarifications. 
   * This is why our Live Classes are being loved far and wide and also the reason why names like Google and Sequoia have backed us. 
   * A Teacher in school is over stretched and cannot address all the doubts of the children in class. It is this unaddressed doubt that comes back and bites in later years. 


5) Where are your teachers from?


* Well qualified: Top colleges of India who have a passion for teaching Math backed with an MS, MCA,Well qualified etc. They also have to be certified on the Cuemath Method. 


* Empathy Test : Before they come on to the platform they have to pass an empathy evaluation.  Most of them are mothers or parents. They understand with their own experience how to get the best out of their kid. 


* Teach our own kids : And even more importantly all of them teach their own child at Cuemath, if they have a school going child. This is a must. We don't teach others what we don't teach our own kids. 


6) WHY MATH AND NOT JUST CODING 


BECAUSE SUNDAR PICHAI SAID SO 
A World Economic Forum Study says – XX Million of today’s jobs will be "LOST" to AI. We can see this in all sectors from Trading, Technology and even Medicine. The next 10 years the world will become the AI world.   
* And AI = Math 
* Sundar Pichai, Google CEO has said, since AI algorithms are actually math, to become good at ML/AI it is more important to be good at math than coding.  
CODING WITHOUT MATH IS LIKE A HIGH SCHOOL DIPLOMA / DIPLOMA / NOT A COLLEGE DEGREE
All significant programming problems are math problems not just coding problems. All high level computing is Math. AI = Math. AI is not Coding.  
Coding without Math is the difference between a CA and a Clerk. 
Coding without Math like a high school diploma without an engineering degree. 


LANGUAGES COME AND GO : MATH REMAINS 
And languages come and go. Yesterday Fortran in the 80s, later C, today R and Python and maybe tomorrow something else. Math remains and builds over decades.  


PROBLEM SOLVING WAS NEVER MORE IMPORTANT 
With AI taking 80 Million jobs in 2020, the need to be a PROBLEM SOLVER is now stronger than ever. According to Mckinsey, in just 5-10 years, just as your kid is in college/leaving school only 5% of people will be creating AI based models and giving orders to the machine, 95% will be taking orders from the machine. MATH and ONLY MATH can enable your kid to be A PROBLEM SOLVER - A DECISION MAKER - top 5% in this new world.


EVERYTHING YOU THINK IS CODING IS ACTUALLY MATH 
In Short there is math in everything we use on a daily basis. Very different from 10 years ago and this will accelerate as the world becomes an AI world.

7) WHAT IMMEDIATE RESULTS CAN I SEE 


RESULTS STEP 1 : LOVE MATH IN 3-6 MONTHS
With this, the single biggest difference that you'll see within 6 months is that your kid will Love Math and will love coming to Math class. And we know Nothing boosts the confidence of a school kid like proficiency in math or a sport. But it will take 3- 6 months.


PLEASE BE PATIENT. AND HELP THE TEACHER HELP THE CHILD.  


STEP 2 : LIFE-LONG ADVANTAGE 
PROBLEM SOLVING MINDSET IN 6-12 MONTHS IS A “FUNDAMENTAL SHIFT” AND A “LIFE-LONG ADVANTAGE” THEY WILL BECOME A DECISION MAKER RATHER 
 
When they get better at MATH they will develop the PROBLEM SOLVING MINDSET QUICKLY. There'll be a fundamental psychological shift, as she/he will start thinking that he or she can solve problems and more importantly WANT TO SOLVE THEM.  


This is more important than marks.  


The earlier the shift happens in a kid, the earlier they will make a massive impact in the world. He or she will become a decision maker  (The top 5%) How can you see this every day? 
  
WHY > WHAT : They will begin to start asking WHY? Not just FOLLOW instructions on WHAT to do? from “someone else”
CREATORS : They will want to experiment and create, not just use “someone else’s” creation
DATA > OPINION : Start asking for Data and Evidence, not just follow “someone else’s” opinion 
OPTIMAL > PERFECT : You child will be able to make different decisions depending on the circumstances, not just follow the same pattern again and again 
AND IT HAS IMMEDIATE PRACTICAL RESULTS LIKE A BETTER COLLEGE 
In today's world if class X exams had 500 Marks, probably math would account for 250 of those 500 / Math is already 50% of SAT. And logical problem solving ability is the other major part of SAT, which is heavily dependent on math. 
8) How can I know that this is not a fraud company?




* Please Google me now 
Here is my name. (make sure everyone has a LINKED IN PROFILE) Here is my CEO’s name. 


* Please Google my CEO now 
Please check on LinkedIn and My CEO on Google as well. you should look my CEO Mr. Manan who has personally taught over 10,000 Kids. We have that DNA and passion for teaching. 
  
* BACKED BY TECH NO.1 AND INVESTOR NO.1 
Backed By Google And Sequoia as Investors. Biggest names in the world.  


* GLOBAL : Students from 17 countries, large countries, with a total population of 2 Billion, almost ⅓ of humanity. Our largest business market is actually the USA. 


* NO-QUESTIONS ASKED, 7 DAY REFUND POLICY
First week you can cancel and get 100% back. Any other time 50% refund. For some reasons if your timing is changed and the teacher timing is not matching we will find another teacher. However our windoW for classes is - XXXX TO XXXX, Monday to Saturday. 


* FREE RESCHEDULE
You can decide the date and time of the class. Between Mon - Fri 4 to 9 pm and Saturday - Sunday 9 am to 9 pm, you need to select any 2 classes of your choice. Non consecutive days IS mandatory. As that increases learning outcomes. 
9) HOW ARE YOUR CLASSES DIFFERENT FROM SCHOOL ?


1:1 ATTENTION 
What is the size of your kid’s class in school? Here we give 1:1 / 1:3 students in a class. This makes a dramatic difference in outcomes. It’s like getting a personal GYM trainer for your kids mind. We know the difference in the Gym just with a trainer and just watching a video.   
WE TEACH VISUALLY, YOUR KID WILL NEVER FORGET
WE TEACH VISUALLY, YOUR KID WILL DEVELOP INTUITION FOR PROBLEM SOLVING.


We teach math like a language by focusing on UNDERSTANDING not KNOWLEDGE
Using the Cue-Math Method our goal is for Kids to develop intuition for math problem solving. 
UNDERSTAND NATURALLY / INTUITIVELY!
Never forget : Visual Methods and Simulations engage more of the brain, ALMOST ALL of the brain.  
That is why 70% of our curriculum problems are Visual. Simulations and Visulas engage more than 4 different areas of the brain leading to better and faster UNDERSTANDING.  
When kids understand Math,  they start liking and loving math. Which every concept has on an average 2-3 simulations and all important concepts have visual solutions/proofs.  
WE HELP THE KID “SELF ARRIVE” AT THE ANSWER. THAT IS WHY WE ARE CALLED “CUE”-MATH. CUE NEVER TELL. 
Just like it’s difficult to learn english on your own, we have a teacher to help learn Math. By training the teacher to Cue the answer and never tell it. When kids arrive at the solution “themselves” they never forget. And this builds intuition. 
As you can see there is a reason why we are called Cue Math, always a teacher to “Cue” the solution, never tell. 
CASE STUDIES : MATH NEEDS TO BE LEARNT DIFFERENTLY FROM SCHOOL, IT NEEDS TO BE LEARNT VISUALLY. 
Example 1 : Sometime a go with did survey with some school students and asked them which number is greater – 0.19 or 0.2? most of them had 0.19 as there answer as it had Number 19 in it.
Example 2 : Understand that multiplication is nothing but repeated addition. Don’t need to remember just derive. 19x20 = 20x20 -20, no need to remember it as 380.
Example 3 : When we ask Grade 3 kids what 4 x 19 = 76, What 19 x 4 is, they say we have not done 19 tables yet.    
Example 4: 1/2+1/4 =2/6 = Mechanistic, no one as explained “fractions are nothing but part of a whole”  
However, in Cuemath students learn Decimal/Fractions,  in a different way. “Mainly” through Visual Modelling of blocks, they engage more of the brain,  and hence it becomes easier and faster and they “Never forget”.
